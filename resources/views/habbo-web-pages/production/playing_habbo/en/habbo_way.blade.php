        class="align-right"></p>
<h4>Troll</h4>

    criminal.</p>
<h4>Trick or cheat</h4>
<p>Cheaters and tricksters never prosper; they just spoil everyone else&apos;s {{$chocolatey->hotelName}}
    experience.</p>
<p><img src="{{$chocolatey->hotelUrl}}habbo-web/assets/web-images/habboway_7b.png" alt="Don&apos;t sell for real money"
        class="align-right"></p>
<h4>Sell for real money</h4>
<p>Never sell your furni, account, password or anything in the game for real money. You will lose everything, plus you&apos;ll
    have wasted all the time and effort it took to collect those things!</p>
<h4>Place or accept bets</h4>
<p>Using furni that randomizes games, with the possibility to place bets, might get you into trouble. Why leave it to
    chance? Just don&apos;t do it!</p>
<p><img src="{{$chocolatey->hotelUrl}}habbo-web/assets/web-images/habboway_3b.png" alt="Don&apos;t cyber"
        class="align-right"></p>
<h4>Cyber</h4>
<p>Cybering is <strong>strictly</strong> forbidden. Cam requests will result in punishment. Remember: Never meet up with
    people you met online. They aren&apos;t always who they claim to be!</p>
