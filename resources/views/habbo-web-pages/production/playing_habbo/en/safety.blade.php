<h3>Protect Your Personal Info</h3>
<p>You never know who you&apos;re truly speaking to online, so never share your personal information! Giving away your
    personal info - real name, address, phone numbers, photos or school - could lead to you being scammed, bullied or
    put in serious danger.</p>

<h3>Don&apos;t Give In To Peer Pressure</h3>
<p>Just because everyone else seems to be doing it, doesn&apos;t mean you have to. If you are not comfortable with
    something, don&apos;t do it!</p>

<h3>Keep Your Pals In Pixels</h3>
<p>Do not meet up with someone you only know from the internet! People aren&apos;t always who they claim to be. If a
    {{$chocolatey->hotelName}} asks you to meet with them in real life say &quot;No,
    thanks!&quot; and immediately tell a moderator, your
    parents or another trusted adult.</p>

<h3>Don&apos;t Be Scared To Speak Up</h3>
<p>If someone is making you feel uncomfortable, threatening you, or pressuring you to do something you don&apos;t want
    to, report them immediately to a moderator using the &quot;Call for Help&quot; button.</p>

</p>
<h3>Ban The Cam</h3>
<p>You have no control over your personal photos, videos + webcam images after you share them on the internet. Once an
    image is posted, it can never be removed, will be viewable by anyone and could be used to bully or blackmail you.
    Before you share a pic or video, ask yourself; are you comfortable with people you don&apos;t know viewing it?</p>

<h3>Stick To The Real {{$chocolatey->hotelName}} </h3>
<p>Websites that offer free prizes, credits, furni, or &quot;staff rights&quot; are ALL scams designed to steal your
    password. Never give them your login details or download files from these websites. They could be keyloggers or
    viruses!</p>
